# Image-Processing-to-Detect-Presence-of-Mosquito-Larvae
### Using image processing technique the presence of larvae is detected to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes to prevent malaria<br>
• By using Image processing techniques we can detect the larvae present in the water body or stagnant water and prevent its growth.<br>
• Using Image processing the larvae presence is detected and its stages and using machine learning the system is trained to detect its presence.<br>
• Once the mosquito breeding area is identified the government authorities are informed about these regions to do the needful.<br>
• **Algorithm Used for Image Segmentaion**:Salt and Pepper Algorithm<br>
• **Clustering method**:K-means Clustering<br>
• **Languages & Tools Used**: Matlab,Arduino IDE,Anroid Studio<br>
